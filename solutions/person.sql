-- In the person.sql file, write out the code for the following problems:

-- Create a table called person that records a personâ€™s id, name, age, height (in cm) , city, favorite_color. The id should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key (use type: SERIAL)
create table person (id serial primary key, name varchar(30) not null, age int not null, height, city, favorite_color) 
-- Add 5 different people into the person database. Remember to not include the person_id because it should auto-increment.
insert into person (name, age, height, city, favorite_color) values ('Sandra', 31, 180, 'San Diego', 'Pink'),
('Sonny', 27, 172, 'San Francisco', 'Teal'),
